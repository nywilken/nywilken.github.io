A native New Yorker, born and raised in Brooklyn, of Latin descent with a thing for technology.

### What I Do?

I'm a Software Engineer working with Ruby, and Go. Outside of work, I'm an Open Source contributor, a mentor, family man, an advocate for kindness!

### My Interest!

Go - The Go language is insane - there I said it. But more importantly giving back. I am where I am because of the many people who have helped me get here, family, friends, and random strangers. I'm grateful for that help and I am working on paying it forward.
