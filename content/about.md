Iâ€™m an Open Source, Software Engineer by trade with a passion for Go, mentoring, and community building. When not coding, I lead the GDN (Go Developer Network) program, as a contributing member to GoBridge,  working to continue the mission of increasing diversity within the Go community and empowering the next generation of Go developers. 

I am where I am because of the many people who have helped me get here, family, friends, and random strangers. I'm grateful for that help and I am working on paying it forward.
