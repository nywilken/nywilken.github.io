In the spirit of [Tiny Habits](https://tinyhabits.com ), the process of building sustainable habits by marking them super small, 
I am starting a new series of posts called Tiny Learnings. Tiny learnings will be a series of small blog posts 
about a thing I learned in the week to help me create a habit of writing. With my newly formed habit of taking 15 minutes of my 
mornings to practice my craft, finding something to write about should be as showing up. 

As Confucius said, "_The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones._"
