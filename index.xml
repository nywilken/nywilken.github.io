      <description>ReReRe, short for Review/Retest/Reflect, is my three phase process for reviewing code changes. It is one of the key processes that Iâ€™ve come to rely on for learning and growing my craft.
Side note, I refer to GitHub and its pull request system within the post; however, ReReRe works independently of GitHub and should work for any team with a formal code review process. In fact, I generally review code changes locally within my editor, as opposed to on GitHub, to allow for off-line reviews.</description>

      <description>This is Me! A native New Yorker, born and raised in Brooklyn, of Latin descent with a thing for technology.
What I Do? I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer based out of NYC, working with Ruby, JavaScript, and Go. Out side of work, I&amp;rsquo;m an Open Source contributor, a mentor, family man, an advocate for kindness!
My Latest Interest? Go, the language is insane - there I said it! But more importantly giving back.</description>
