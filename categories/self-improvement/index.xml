      <description>ReReRe, short for Review/Retest/Reflect, is my three phase process for reviewing code changes. It is one of the key processes that Iâ€™ve come to rely on for learning and growing my craft.
Side note, I refer to GitHub and its pull request system within the post; however, ReReRe works independently of GitHub and should work for any team with a formal code review process. In fact, I generally review code changes locally within my editor, as opposed to on GitHub, to allow for off-line reviews.</description>
